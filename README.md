Some discord tricks that I think are cool:
\@mention in a server still pings but removes the blue box around it
Clyde the bot discord uses when you cant message someone or an errror happened shares the same username as the ai Clyde despite having different user ids and profiles.
You cant ban Clyde no matter how much you try.
Also you can message the discord account. The message wont go thru but u can
