Some discord tricks that I think are cool:
\@mention in a server still pings but removes the blue box around it
Clyde the bot discord uses when you cant message someone or an errror happened shares the same username as the ai Clyde despite having different user ids and profiles.
You cant ban Clyde no matter how much you try.
Also you can message the discord account. The message wont go thru but you can by doing the following
/msg user:643945264868098049 text:[insert text here] (discord#0000)
/msg user:1232523165893132288 text:[insert text here] (discord updates)
/msg user:669627189624307712 text:[insert text here] (community updates#0001)
